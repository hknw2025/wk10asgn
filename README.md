# Week 10 Asignment - Building a Personal Movie Database with Go

This tool takes CSV data, reads it, and pushes it into a SQLite database. The SQLite database is correctly constructed as can be seen with the tests showing that the two tables can be joined. 

## How to use this tool and examples:
* After cloning this git repository you can `go run main.go`
* You will create a SQLite local database containing the SQL version of the CSV data. Additionally you can run the unit tests with `go test` to see the join accurately preformed

I was having trouble with this assignment because I felt like the documentation for the Golang SQL tools was not very usable. I thus relied on ChatGPT to help me write the code for this assignment, especially the SQL heavy pulling and pushing portions of the code. My conversation with ChatGPT helped me greatly, and I was impressed with its ability to code for a set of packages that do not have much online documentation. I placed the link to my conversation in the repository.
